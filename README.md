# cart-exercise

In this project, we used Strapi, a content management system that allows you to build your own API. You'll have to build your own API with Strapi to hold the data found in the products array. 

You can add items from the product list into your cart, and your shopping cart will keep track of the total cost of items you are "buying". You can remove items from the cart by clicking on them. The "restock products" button under the list of products will prompt a call to the API url (which contains the total product information) in order to refresh the stock.

The exercise is less of a functional exercise and more of a simulation to show how to integrate a backend API with a react application.
